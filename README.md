## About MiSOS App

A web platform designed to connect migrants/expatriates to vital support resources, information, and direct help. Users can browse and contribute to a curated list of local support services, and find help relevant to their needs.

**Why was this built?**  
Moving to a new country can be overwhelming. Migrants often struggle to find trustworthy information about support services and legal guidance. They may also need immediate help. This app was created to address that gap and empower newcomers by providing a centralized resource.
